Incident Management
Incident Management is a process of IT Service Management (ITSM) focused on returning the performance of Walmart's technology services to normal as quickly as possible through remediation.


Incident : Something is broken, and you need to troubleshoot it and return to service ASAP, based upon SLA

Major Incident (MI): Critical functionality is broken and you need to review, coordinate support, resolve, and implement ASAP

Problem: Understanding the cause of an incident, performing root-cause analysis, identifying errors, and creating knowledge, based on the priority

Service Request: You have a common request with a pre-defined workflow and checklist and can schedule based on SLA

Change: Modifying the live environment, determining approach, assessing risk, obtaining approvals, and implementing based on release schedule and maintenance windows

Defect: An application is not functioning correctly, and you need to identify the issue and develop and implement a solution based on SLA and backlog
